        <p> To break a line in HTML use the single "br /"", its the prefix of break, space and a forward slash .</p>
        <p> This line ... <br /> ...is broken</p>
        <center>
            <p>
                You can also center things by using "center". You just need to enclose a tag pair inside the center tag pair. Pay attention to the organization of your code.
            </p>
        </center>
        <hr />
        <p> 
            You can get better results by dividing the sections for better visualization. To do this use the single tag "hr /". Now you should be asking 
            why there is a r in the end of this tag. I am... 
        </p>
        <hr />
        <pre>
            <p>
                Now imagine that you are typing just a part of the HTML document, but want it to follow the same format of the rest of the document. 
                <br /> 
                In This case you can use the tag pair "pre" to enclose the tag pair with content.
            </p>
        <pre/>
        <p>Now suppose you want write Asian Soccer Society, and dont want the browser to show up with the following appearance:</p>
        <p>Asian<br />Soccer<br />Society<br /> </p>
        <p>Then you can use the non-space break entity Asian&nbsp;Soccer&nbsp;Society</p> 
        <p>To end this document let us introduce some terminology. A single tag is known as "void HTML element".</p>
        <p>On the other hand a tag pair is known simple as "HTML element". NEXT: attributes</p>
