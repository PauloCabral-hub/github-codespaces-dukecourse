        <p align="center">
           Attributes are how you set properties of an element.
           They are inserted in the first element of the tag
           pair, after a space. You put the atribute_name="atribute value" 
        </p>
        <p align="center">The mean attributes that almost each class have are the following:
           <b>Id</b>,<b>Title</b>,<b>Class</b> and <b>Style</b>.
        </p>
        <p style="color:red">
        The <b>Id</b> is very important becouse allows you to uniquely identify an element
        inside the HTML. Said that, you should not name two tags with the same <b>Id</b>.
        The <b>Title</b> shows in a box whenever the user place the cursor of the element
        in the page. The <b>Class</b> has to do with what we call cascade style sheet or
        CSS, we will leave this one for another moment.
        </p>
        <p dir="rtl"> Do you know that in some languages we read from the right to the left?
            This is the case in Hebrew, for example. HTML can set the direction of the text 
            usin what we call <b>Internationalization attributes</b> such as dir. The default
            value of dir is rtl, however if you are in writing in hebrew you can set it
            to ltr. By applying this attribute value to the html tag, it will be set to the 
            entire document.
