In order to workout the instructions of the class, you will have to
perform some necessary tasks.

Medium is a website with very good content! Remember this whenever 
you need help!

1. In your ubuntu terminal, run the following command:
> sudo apt install mysql-server

2. Check if the stallation was successful by running:
> mysql --version

3. Then, run the following in the commandline:
> sudo mysql -u root -p 

You will be prompted to insert your root password.
After that, you will be directed to MySql shell

4. In the shell, run the following to create a user:
> CREATE USER '<your_user_name>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '<database_root_user_password>';

In our example, we will use:
<your_user_name> = base_user
<database_root_user_password> = pass123

5. Next, you will have to grant access to the user you
just created. To do this, perform the following:
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'base_user'@'localhost';

6. To review the privileges just granted, run the following
> SHOW GRANTS FOR base_user@localhost;

7. To load the privileges that were just granted, run the
following.
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

8. Now you should created your database
> CREATE DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME>;

In our example, we will be using the following:
<DATABASE_NAME> = sampledb

9. Now you can finally quite shell by running:
EXIT;

-----------------------------------------------
Now we recommend installing the following extensions
in VScode:
a. SQL SERVER (mmsql)
b. SQL TOOLS
c. QLTools MySQL/MariaDB (this might have a slightly different name)

Obs.:  After installing these extensions, you can head to the icon in 
the bottom left of the left tab (database symbol), choose MySql, fill
with the information of the database and user we created and connect.
However, this steps might not be necessary (I did not tested). Any doubt
refer to the link in the beggining of the page.
