We will start working with scrapy shell

Run this in the command line
> scrapy shell <url>
ex.: scrapy shell https://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html

You can run the following command inside scrapy shell to get every single table
in the url:
> response.xpath('//table')

To get the number of tables:
> len(response.xpath('//table'))

Our task for now will be to identify the table that has a specific dimension.
We can go through tables to do that. For example:
> response.xpath('//table')[0]

Important: Now we are going to start using some HTML terminology, 'tr' stands
for table row and 'td' stands for table data.

In this case we are looking for the table who has 10719 items in its rows
<check if this is really the case, NEI in the video>.

You will find that the 3rd table is the one we are interested in. Run the
following code:

> len(response.xpath('//table')[3])

Now, we can assign this table to a variable:
table = response.xpath('//table')[3]

To print every row in the table:
> table.xpath('//tr')

But that is not very helpfull, so let us assign a specific row
to another variable:
> child = table.xpath('//tr')[10]

To extract the text in the assigned items
> child.xpath('td//text()')[0].extract()

The syntax of scrapy shell allow loops, you can use tabs to indent each level
> for row in table.xpath('//tr'):
>     try:
>         print(row.xpath('td//text()')[0].extract())
>     except IndexError:
>         pass
