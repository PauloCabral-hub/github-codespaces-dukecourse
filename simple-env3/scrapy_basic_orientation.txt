Scrapy is a library that you should use in a virtual environment
becouse it has a lot of dependencies, so for efficiency reasons
you should keep it to your project:

to install, simply run in the command line the following:
> pip install scrapy

You should see it that after installing scrapy, you can 
create a project by running the following:
> scrapy startproject <project_name>



You can see that after the aforementioned command, a set
of directories and files were created, use tree to see
it:
> tree -L 2 <project_name>

You should see that there is a nested directory with the
same <project_name> and a scrapy.cfg, that is, a configuration
file.

After creating the project, you will see recomendations on how 
to proceed to scrap. Run the following:
> scrapy genspider <spider_name> <domain>
ex.: > scrapy genspider cve cve.mitre.org]

This will create a <spider_name>.py in the current directory

One thing that you should work on is to no the difference between
structured HTML and uninstructured HTML. The former is always 
worse to work with.
