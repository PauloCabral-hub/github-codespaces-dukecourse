1. Let us run the following command:
> scrapy shell  https://quotes.toscrape.com

2. Now, run the following
> response.css("div.quote")

Verify that everything is inside div tag, class quote

3. Let us isolate of the Selectors in a variable
> quote = response.css("div.quote")[0] 

Verify that you have a nested structure, div.quote 0 probably is related to the
first level

IMPORTANT: duplicate the tab so you can inspect the code to know what are you doing.
4. Let us isolate another subelement
> text = quote.css("span.text::text").get()

5. Let us take the the author now:
> author = quote.css("small.author::text").get()

6. Now we are going to get a list of information that is nested inside 
div tag of class tags
> tags = quote.css("div.tags a.tag::text").getall()

Note the space to get the nested information

Now try to iterate the iterables and put this in a dictionary:
for quote in quote.css("div.quote"):
    text = quote.css("span.text::text").get()
    author = quote.css("small.author::text").get()
    tags = quote.css("div.tags a.tag::text").getall()
    print({"text": text, "author": author, "tags": tags})

7. Finally, you can place this in a JSON file by applying the following command:
> scrapy crawl quotes_simplyfied_spider -O quotes.json

IMPORTANT: -O flag overwrites any existing file with the same name. Remember to 
run this from the top project folder.
