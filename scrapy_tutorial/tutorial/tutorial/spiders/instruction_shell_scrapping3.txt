The idea here is to get information from pages and subpages

1. Open scrapy shell and get your response:
> scrapy shell https://quotes.toscrape.com

2. Now get the link by doing
> response.css("li.next a::attr(href)").get()

See that here we have something new the attr(href)

this line is equivalent
> response.css("li.next a").attr["href"]

Implement this the modifications accordingly in quotes_simp_spider2.py

We continue latter with a shortcut for creating requests.
